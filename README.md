## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color palette](documentation/colorspace-palette.png)

- The color scheme for the Shinsei Sushi Academy website has been carefully selected to reflect elements of Japanese culture and create a warm, inviting atmosphere. The primary color, burgundy (#800020), was inspired by the deep red of the Japanese maple leaf and the symbolism of the red circle on the Japanese flag. This rich shade conveys both tradition and sophistication, making it a fitting choice for an educational setting that celebrates Japanese culinary arts and cultural heritage.

- Complementing the burgundy is #f3eed9, a light, neutral tone that adds balance and a sense of calm to the design. This soft background color provides a comfortable contrast, helping the primary elements stand out while creating a spacious, airy feel. The light tone also evokes a sense of openness and simplicity, characteristics often associated with Japanese aesthetics.

- Finally, #d09ea9, a gentle pinkish hue, adds warmth and a welcoming touch to the overall color palette. This color brings an inviting softness to the interface, symbolizing hospitality and harmony, which are central to Japanese culinary philosophy. Together, these colors evoke a sense of tradition, elegance, and warmth, enhancing the user experience and reinforcing the cultural authenticity of the academy's brand.

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/sora-font.png)
